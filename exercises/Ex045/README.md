## Project Euler Exercise 45

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle	 	Tn=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, .. <br>
Pentagonal	 	Pn=n(3n-1)/2	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... <br>
Hexagonal	 	Hn=n(2n-1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... <br>

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

```python
MAXN = int(1e5)
FIND_AFTER = 40755

triangle = lambda n: n*(n+1)/2
pentagonal = lambda n: n*(3*n-1)/2
hexagonal = lambda n: n*(2*n-1)

def populate(func):
    listn = []
    n = 0
    while n <= MAXN:
        n += 1
        listn.append(func(n))
    return listn


tn = populate(triangle)
pn = populate(pentagonal)
hn = populate(hexagonal)

result = 0
for h in hn:
    if h in pn:
        if h in tn:
            if h > FIND_AFTER:
                result = h
                break

print(result)  # 1,533,776,805
```
